# PHYS 351: Applied Numerical Methods
## Fall 2022
Dr. Mike Daugherity, Abilene Christian University

This repository is for code and data files.  All other course information is posted on Canvas.

### Important Note 
Github's notebook renderer is trash.  Pages will often not display correctly. 
**One workaround is to view the pages on [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/mdaugherity/Numerical2022/tree/main/)**.  
Another approach is to open the files directly from Colab.
